##Week 6 | Adding Logging to Python Applications using ELK 

Your assignment for this week your assignment is to add logging to a python application (one you already have or one you create) and feed that logging to your ELK stack.

You are to build 3 visualizations of the data using different logging parameters.   For example, you might have a pie chart on level.  You might have a line graph on another logging parameter you send and a third on yet another logging parameter.   You can pick the visualizations and the parameter but they must be 3 different visualizations and 3 different parameter.

Finally, put the three visualizations on a dashboard.  

You will turn in the python application in an appropriate GitHub repository along with a screen capture of your dashboard.
